# üìù To-Do List

## Notes
- Add any additional notes or ideas here.

### Chaos tasking
- add multiselect for selecting x/y items affected
- 

## Today
- [ ] the next step: in Chaos.jsx, you need to rewrite the handleChange function to work with a list-item instead of a select box
  then you'll have to style all this. Probably better to use conditionals and css instead of visible tag.
- [ ] work on chaos, flesh out what we need to do
- [ ] BPM isn't aligned correctly
- [ ] the mouseDown drag thing is cool, but it should only erase or draw, not toggle states
- [ ] make random UI similar to others? 

---

## Long term
- [ ] get chaos working as expected
- [ ] Add some label for what the chaos pad does
- [ ] make chaos grid assignable? 
- [ ] button bg isn't showing up on git site, how come
- [ ] break up App.js into more reasonable files. export scale, etc to utils, beep should be it's own class
- [ ] add a clear-all button or reset or something
- [ ] add titles to icons
- [ ] what's the biquad filter thing?
- [ ] favicon
- [ ] no reason we couldn't do mod type on chaos, it would be noisy tho lol
